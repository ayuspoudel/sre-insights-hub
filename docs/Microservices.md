### **Event-Driven Communication (Inter-Service Communication)**

* **EventBridge**:

  * Acts as the central **event bus**, routing events from one service to another. For example, a **Task Created** event can trigger a **Notification Service** to alert a user or a **SLA Management Service** to start tracking its deadline.

* **SNS/SQS**:

  * Used for **asynchronous communication** between services, especially when services need to send messages (like notifications) or queue jobs for later processing.



### **Summary of Microservices**

1. **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and profile.
2. **User Profile Service**: Handles user data and profile management.
3. **Task Management Service**: Manages tasks (CRUD operations, assignments, status updates).
4. **Task Logs Service**: Logs all actions related to tasks for auditing.
5. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications for task-related events.
6. **SLA Management Service**: Tracks task SLAs and sends breach alerts.
7. **Analytics Service**: Collects and displays task-related performance metrics.
8. **Admin & Manager Service**: Manages users and monitors team performance.
9. **Task Assignment Automation Service**: Automatically creates and assigns tasks based on CI/CD or system events.
